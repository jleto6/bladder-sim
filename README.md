# Bladder Mechanism Simulation â€“ Concept for Panama Canal

A Unity-based simulation developed as part of a DoD-sponsored project on water conservation in the Panama Canal. This simulation visualizes a bladder-inspired water retention concept proposed by the project sponsor.

This simulation was built in response to a request from a Department of Defense sponsor, who tasked the team with exploring the feasibility of a bladder-inspired mechanism within the Panama Canal.

## Technologies

- Unity (C#)
- Custom visual scripting for flow logic
- Lightweight user interaction and visual feedback
